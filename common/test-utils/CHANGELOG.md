### Minor Changes

- Chore: Forked stitches packages to improve typing and class generation.
  Feat: Added a new flexible and custom theme system. [Read the RFC for all details](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-ui/issues/224) and [check out an example of usage](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-ui/tree/feat/theme-system/examples/custom-theme).
  Feat: Updated `Flex`, `BoxCentered`, `Grid`, and `Stack` components to be used within `Box` as namespaced components _[BREAKING CHANGE]_:
  ```tsx
  import { Box } from '@fuel-ui/react';
  function App() {
    return <Box.Flex>Hello world</Box.Flex>;
  }
  ```
  Feat: Introduced a new polymorphic components system where as props automatically adjust prop typings. Any HTML element can be used in the component prop. For example, using an a tag will render an anchor:
  ```tsx
  import { Button } from '@fuel-ui/react';
  import { IconExternalLink } from '@tabler/icons-react';
  function Demo() {
    return (
      <Button
        component="a"
        href="#"
        variant="outlined"
        leftIcon={<IconExternalLink size={18} />}
      >
        Open in new tab
      </Button>
    );
  }
  ```
  Feat: Refined the default light theme for better clarity and simplicity:
  ```tsx
  import {
    ThemeProvider,
    darkTheme,
    lightTheme,
    useFuelTheme,
  } from '@fuel-ui/react';
  function ThemeWrapper(props: any) {
    const isDark = useSomeHookToDetectIsDark();
    const { setTheme } = useFuelTheme();
    useEffect(() => {
      setTheme(isDark ? darkTheme : lightTheme);
    }, [isDark]);
    return <ThemeProvider>{props.children}</ThemeProvider>;
  }
  ```
  Feat: Added new design tokens in this release. All color tokens are now auto-generated using the `design-system/tokens `project, based on the [Stitches design tokens pattern](https://stitches.dev/docs/tokens) and [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors). Important notes about the new tokens:
  - Always reference the semantic value of a token when using a color, e.g., use `$intentsPrimary9` instead of `$green9`.
  - Semantic colors are available for all necessary layer styles and inputs. A `layer` mixin has been introduced to simplify token usage (see `Button/styles.ts` implementation for more details).
  - New tokens are generated in the `design-tokens/tokens/build/tokens-raw.ts` file after running `pnpm build` inside the package.
  - Understanding and following the new token system is crucial for easy light/dark theme switching.
  - The number of colors and variations in `Button`, `Tag`, and `Badge` has been reduced to only include design system intents.
    Chore: Removed `color` prop from `Button` and all derived/related components. Use `intent` instead.
